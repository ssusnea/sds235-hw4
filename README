This .zip file contains 6 files: 

1. README.txt, this text file you are reading right now
2. SDS 235 HW4 Final Report.pdf, the pdf which contains the visualizations and the report to present to the “sponsor”
3. sketches.pdf, a pdf file of our visualization sketches
4. Firewall_vis.ipynb, python code used to generate the visualizations for the firewall data
5. FinalCharts.qmd, R code used to generate the visualizations for the IDS data
6. Homework 4 Reflection.pdf, a pdf file with our reflection on the assignment


Instructions:
Please place all submitted files in the same directory so that the codes can be run. Also, please create a folder named `hw4-data` within the directory and put all csv data into this hw4-data folder (we did this because everyone has different folders and locations of data when they were downloaded).

To run the Python code, open the Firewall_vis.ipynb file in Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook. It is recommended to have your window wider to have a better viewing experience. Install all the packages in the terminal using “pip install package-name”. Then, you will be able to run all Python codes and see the data wrangling sections and their visualizations.

To run the R code, open the FinalCharts.qmd file in RStudio. Install all the packages and you will be able to run the codes.
