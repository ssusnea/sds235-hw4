```{r}
library(tidyverse)

IDS0406 <- read_csv("hw4-data/IDS-0406.csv")
IDS0407 <- read_csv("hw4-data/IDS-0407.csv")
```

```{r}
# interested to see the number of different websites visited and how many times each one appears in the data. 
IDS0406 |> 
  group_by(xref) |> 
  count(xref) |> View()

IDS0406 |> 
  group_by(sourcePort) |> 
  count(sourcePort) |> View()

# 6667 shows up the most often? 

IDS0406 |> 
  group_by(classification) |> 
  count(classification) |> View()

# Potentially Bad Traffic, Attempted Information Leak, Potential Corporate Privacy Violation
```

we will assume that if an IP shows up that's not in the system, that would be bad
